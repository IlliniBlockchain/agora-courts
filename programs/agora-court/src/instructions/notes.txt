ok, for commit-reveal:

- currently keeping track of leader which determines winner when closing and claim without having to pass other accounts in
- can still do this, but only when reveals are being counted ig

- when commit, only hash should be held

***THINGS TO CHECK:***
- when no one votes
- when there aren't enough votes
- not enough ppl submit cases
- interact more than once
- init case goes into len of record
- voting/reveal -> close, check can_close(), if no one reveals somehow
- change constraint in select_vote on record to impl logic in tx to allow vote changing
- TIES ARE LITERALLYY NOT HANDLED LOL
