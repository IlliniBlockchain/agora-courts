NEEDS ATTENTION:
- TIES
- withdraw protocol amounts ix
- not enough ppl submit cases
- interact more than once


THINGS TO CHECK:
- when there aren't enough votes
- not enough ppl submit cases
- init case goes into len of record
- change constraint in select_vote on record to impl logic in tx to allow vote changing
- let protocol withdraw funds if inconclusive - do it automatically with close :0

For disputes:
- what if someone joins a dispute and it doesn't need to start timers until the other person joins

TEST CASES:
everyone does everything right -> works
no one reveals -> works
no one votes -> works
votes < min votes -> not tested, should work
filling up voter record -> works
